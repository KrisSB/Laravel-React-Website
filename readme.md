# Laravel and React based website.

This website was made using both Laravel and React, with a stronger emphasis on react. The website uses a lot of fetch requests to get information from the database, to create seemless Single Page Applications.

The main features of the project were focused around filtering Articles using both a sorter focused on letter and a search bar where you can look up a page instantly.

Some important skills used on the website:

- REST APIs
- Fetch / Promises 
- Single Page Application development

Was made with:

- Laravel PHP as the back-end
- React as the front-end
- Node.js was used to handle most the JS
